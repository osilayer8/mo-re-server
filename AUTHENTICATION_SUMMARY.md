# Authentication Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **User Authentication System**
- JWT-based authentication with bcryptjs password hashing
- Secure password storage (12 salt rounds)
- Token-based authentication for all protected routes

### 2. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added `users` table with email, password, firstName, lastName
- Added `userId` foreign key to `customers`, `projects`, and `tasks` tables
- Added `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints for data integrity
- Added `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps

### 3. **User Data Isolation**
- ✅ **Each user can only see their own customers**
- ✅ **Each user can only see their own projects**
- ✅ **Each user can only see their own tasks**
- ✅ **All CRUD operations are user-scoped**

### 4. **API Endpoints**

#### Authentication Routes (`/api/auth`)
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/change-password` - Change password

#### Protected Routes (All require JWT token)
- `GET /api/customers` - User's customers only
- `POST /api/customers` - Create customer for user
- `PUT /api/customers/:id` - Update user's customer only
- `DELETE /api/customers/:id` - Delete user's customer only
- Same pattern for projects and tasks

### 5. **Security Features**
- ✅ Password hashing with bcryptjs
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ User data isolation at database level
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Proper error logging
- ✅ Protection against unauthorized access

### 6. **Migration & Test Data**
- Created test user: `` / ``
- Migrated all existing data to test user (3 customers, 4 projects, 7 tasks)
- All existing data is now properly associated with the test user

## 🧪 Test Results
All authentication tests passed:
- ✅ Login with test user works
- ✅ Authenticated access to user's data works
- ✅ Unauthorized access is properly blocked (401 errors)
- ✅ New customer creation works with proper user association
- ✅ User profile access works

## 🔐 Test User Credentials
- **Email:** ``
- **Password:** ``
- **User ID:** 1

## 🚀 Next Steps for Frontend
1. **Update Vue.js frontend** to handle authentication:
   - Create login/register forms
   - Store JWT tokens (localStorage/sessionStorage)
   - Add Authorization header to all API requests
   - Handle token expiration and refresh
   - Add logout functionality
   - Update composables to work with authenticated endpoints

2. **User Experience:**
   - Protected routes in Vue Router
   - Loading states during authentication
   - Error handling for auth failures
   - User profile management

## 🔗 Usage Example
```javascript
// Login
const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ email: '', password: '' })
});
const { token } = await response.json();

// Access protected endpoint
const customers = await fetch('/api/customers', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

**The backend authentication system is now complete and fully functional!** 🎯
